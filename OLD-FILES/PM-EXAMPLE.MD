Subject:
Acme Rocket Ship Development Project

Project Description:
* Assemble and test 15 do-it-yourself rocket ships for sale to the roadrunner-chasing coyote target market located in the American Southwest
Project Status:
* A prototype rocket has been designed based on NASA input.
* We have translated the instructions from geek-speak to modern coyote dialect.
* We are now actively soliciting test coyotes to assemble test rockets.
Activities Performed During This Reporting Period:
* Hired certified animal communicator to translate rocket documentation into coyote dialect.
* Placed newspaper and magazine ads in Arizona and New Mexico soliciting coyote test subjects.
Activities Planned for Next Reporting Period:
* Update on coyote recruitment efforts for rocket assembly testing.
Issues/Resolutions:
* Coyotes lack opposable thumbs. This might make assembly efforts difficult.
* We are consulting with the wolves in legal to see if there is air-tight wording to absolve us from liability should the rockets explode while the coyote test subjects (and later coyote consumers) are assembling and deploying them.
Project Change Activity:
* Based on recommendations by Engineering, we are substituting TNT for hydrogen and liquid oxygen fuel packs.
Problems, Concerns and Recommendations:
* See issues/resolutions above, first bulleted point.
* Has anyone checked with financial institutes issuing credit cards to coyotes to determine maximum credit levels? These rockets will cost at least $500,000 each.
* The ACME logo on the side of the rockets should be bigger. I recommend that we speak to Marketing about that.
* We need to get a publicity team from Warner Brothers here ASAP for promotional purposes.
